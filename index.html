                <h3> Highschool subjects</h3>
                    <p>
                        During highschool I had a lot of different subject. In my first year, I had the basics such as mathematics,
                        Norwegian, English, History and so on. In my second year, where you can choose your subjects more, I chose to 
                        continue with math, English, as well as taking physics and programming. In my last year, I did a switch to more
                        social subject such as politics, English, and german. The reason for the switch, was mostly because my
                        career-advisor told me that that was the best choice based on my grades, but I kept programming a lot in my spare time
                        and I have since then been programming a lot as a hobby. 
                    </p>
                    <h3> Coding skills</h3>
                    <p>
                        My coding skills are mostly self-taught. I did however, as previously mentioned, take programming 
                        as a subject in my second year. Here I learned a lot of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which is the 
                        foundation of which I have built my programming skills as the stand now. 
                        I have also learned a lot of Python and I have made some projects in my spare time. Although I have to 
                        admit that my skills in Python are mostly basics. 
                    </p>
                    <h3> Hobbies</h3>
                    <p>
                        My hobbies have changed a lot over the years, but I have always been interested in sports.
                        I played football for almost 10 years, but I was never any good, really. I did the switch just before 
                        middleschool, and went on the biking instead. More specifically, mountainbiking. I really like
                        to go for long rides either in the mountain or in the woods, as long as there is some good trails.
                        I have also been skiing since I was little, but I never really found the interest. 
                        Alongside sports, I have always been interested in technology, and some gaming. I particularly learing new 
                        skills within tech, and to implement theory into some more practical.

                    Highschool subjects
                </h3>
                <p>
                    My highschool studies was a vocational schooling program. The subjects we had that differed was
                    programming, tech-support, servers and internship programs. We used a couple of different programming/coding languages and that would be

                    <li>HTML</li>
                    <li>CSS</li>
                    <li>JavaScript</li>
                    <li>Python</li>
                    <li>PHP</li>
                    <li>SQL</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Coding skills</h3>
                <p>
                    Even tho i had some programming in my vocational studies the main way i learned coding was primaraly through W3 schools, youtube and classmates.
                    My coolest coding/programming project thus far has been a combination of PHP and SQl to setup a database. That database was used to store weatherdata that was collected with a RPi using Python on a weatherhat. The data was presented on a website using HTML, CSS and PHP.
                </p>
                <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                <p>
                    My hobbies are quite different in a lot of ways. The hobby i spend most time presuing for the time is chess and trying to 
                    improve my middlegame due to it beeing my worst prospect for the time beeing. In second place i have bodybuilding/powerlifting to keep my mind sharp 
                    i always try to stay active and my favorite part of bodybuilding is seeing the steady progress that omes with consitency.

                    Ronan Dunne is a Mountain biker from Ireland. He is 23 years old 
                    and races for Red Bull. Despite his young age, he has already won 2 world cups
                    and is considered one of the best in the world. I admire him for his fearless riding style and his ability to stay calm under pressure.

                    My favourite travel destination is Italy, and more specifically Florence and Tuscany.
                    I have been to Italy more times than I can remember, and I love everything about it. 
                    I especially love Florence because my Father and Step-Mother got married there 
                    in 2015. We went back this summer for a 10-year anniversary trip and everything
                    was just as I remembered. 
                    Everything from the hot weather, culture, arcitecture and food is just perfect.

                    I really wanna travel to Japan for a multitude of reasons but if i had to narrow it down i think the parts i would be most exited about i would say nature, arcitecture, culture and infrastructure.
